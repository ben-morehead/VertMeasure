# Digital Vertical Jump Tester

## Introduction

I've always found demonstrations to be the best way to introduce any project, it gets right to the point. This project is a digital vertical jump tester, meant mainly as a performance measurement tool to help with explosivity tracking. As a coach, and low-tier athlete, measurements are essential to progress, and vertical jump measurement solutions tend to be inconsistent or just straight up expensive. I figured I was smart enough now to actually solve my own niche problems with my new fancy degree, so I built a video processor using Python, OpenCV and MediaPipe, that will measure a wide variety of jumping videos.

Here is a gif of me dunking

Using those videos as examples, the project produced jump values of 33.97 and 35.67 respectively, it also produced these demonstration videos to show exactly how the measurement was obtained. This is a built in piece of the software.

As a functional addition, I also attempted to measure the different components of the jump. Specifically I wanted to look at descent speed (so the ability to drop the shoulders and hips before launching), the ground contact time (to see how quickly I'm accelerating upwards from my descent), and the descent level (to see how low I get on each jump). In a running video like this, these statistics tend to be less useful, however in stationary tests they can be useful metrics to track how different approaches to explosivity training are contributing to the someone's vertical jump. The measured values are loosely marked on the shoulder level plot (displayed below) that the program generates for the user.
