# Digital Vertical Jump Tester

## Introduction

I've always found demonstrations to be the best way to introduce any project, it gets right to the point. This project is a digital vertical jump tester, meant mainly as a performance measurement tool to help with explosivity tracking. As a coach, and low-tier athlete, measurements are essential to progress, and vertical jump measurement solutions tend to be inconsistent or just straight up expensive. I figured I was smart enough now to actually solve my own niche problems with my new fancy degree, so I built a video processor that will measure multiple different types of jumping videos.

Here is a gif of me dunking

And another one

When sending that video through my project it told me I jumped ___ and ___ respectively, and gave me these demonstration videos to show exactly how the measurement was obtained. This is a built in piece of the software.
